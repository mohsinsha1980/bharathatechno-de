        <h2>Top 5 Use Cases of Next.js</h2>
        <h3>1. SEO-Friendly Websites</h3>
        <p>
          Next.js is the most preferred choice for building websites that need
          strong visibility on search engines. Its support for server-side
          rendering and static site generation guarantees that content is
          delivered fast and can be easily indexed by search engines. This
          feature makes it highly effective for pages where organic traffic
          plays an important role.
        </p>
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Increases search engine visibility through optimized rendering
          </li>
          <li>Make sure fast page load times, improving user experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. E-Commerce Platforms</h3>
        <p>
          Next.js is widely used in e-commerce for creating high-performance
          shopping experiences. It allows for dynamic routing, smooth product
          rendering, and easy checkout processes. You can integrate it with
          third-party services for inventory, payments, or marketing automation,
          which makes it a highly flexible option for online stores.
        </p>
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>

            Allows real-time updates and dynamic page content for better
            scalability
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Full-Stack Web Applications</h3>
        <p>
          Next.js supports full-stack development through built-in API routes.
          This allows developers to manage both frontend and backend logic
          within the same project. It simplifies development workflows, and it
          is a go-to choice for building tools like dashboards, portals, and
          internal platforms.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Static Websites</h3>
        <p>
          For content that doesn&apos;t change frequently, static websites built
          with Next.js offer excellent performance and low maintenance. These
          are commonly used for personal portfolios, company information pages,
          and documentation.
        </p>
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>

          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Hybrid Web Applications</h3>
        <p>
          Next.js allows a mix of static generation, server-side rendering, and
          client-side rendering within one application. This flexibility makes
          it suitable for complex web platforms that require both performance
          and interactivity.
        </p>
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
